In order to re-use the oldest objects, when our memory gets full, we will keep a linked-list.   This means that when we 
use an entry, it will be added to the mru (head) of the list.   Leaving the least used objects at the lru (tail).

Therefore, when an object has a next and prev point.  Next is pointing towards the mru, and prev is pointing to the lru.
