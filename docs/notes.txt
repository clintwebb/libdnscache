The dnscache library is intended to provide a simple cache storage of dns lookups.   
It does not actually perform any lookups itself, that is outside of the scope of this project.

Lookups can be done using evdns, or the blocking socket routines.

The cache is can be initialised and empty, or a file can be imported that populates the cache.

The cache will need to observer TTL's that are provided with results.

Routines we will need.

	init - Initialise the cache structure. will be empty.
	free - Prepare the cache structure to be de-allocated.  Free's all memory that was created for it.

	load - Load cache entries from a specified file.  File is a text based csv.
	save - save the cached entries to a file so it can be loaded later.

	get - Check the cache for an entry.  
	set - Set details for an entry (replace if entry already exists)

	pack - where possible reduce memory that is used by the cache.  remove expired items
