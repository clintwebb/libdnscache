We will need to have the ability to limit the amount of resources that we will use.   

This would likely be the maximum number of kilobytes that the library uses for the cache.

To enforce these limits, we will need to either keep track of the memory used, or be able to calculate how much is used, 
and try not to go over the limit.

When we have reached our limit, we would purge out entries that are the least used.
